        <h2 class="typography-headings">Marcellus</h2>
        <p class="typography-text">For the headers of the Arvada Chamber of Commerce website I will be using the font Marcellus.</p>
        <p class="typography-text">This font is a serif font with a thicker line. It is bold without being obnoxious and will serve my purposes well of bring attention to headers while being easy to read and professional looking as well.</p><br>
        <h2 class="typography-headings">Lato</h2>
        <p class="typography-text">The Lato font will be used for all blocks of text in the website. It is a sans serif font that is good for large or long blocks of text. It is readable without being boring.</p>
        <p class="typography-text">The Lato font also has 10 different styles, thin, italized, bold, etc, which makes it very usable in different situations and for different feels in different sections while still presesnting a cohesive look to the site.</p>
