            <h3>Perfection in Preston</h3>            
            <img class="article-img" src="images/benjamin-davies-400x299.jpg" alt="Perfect Preston farm scene" width="400" height ="299">
            <p>By Emily Lemmon</p>
            <p>Today is a momentous day. Today is the day that Preston becomes the most perfect town anyone has ever heard of. How will it accomplish this prodigious task? By none other than yours truly proclaiming it so. Understanding the perfection of Preston is not for the faint hearted. It takes dedication. It takes perserverance. It takes a strong mind to be able to behold the full glory that is Preston Idaho.<br>
                <br>
                First we begin with the sky. Have you ever seen a sky that is a more perfecrt sky. It's blue. It's big. It's bodacious. How is it bodacious? No one really knows, and yet, it is. Only the sky in Preston could manage this. The birds all agree, they have never flown in such a sky before. It's largeness cannot be emphasized enough. It is immense. It is expansive. It is enormous. You have never seen such a monstrous, gigantic sky. Even giants agree that this sky in Preston doesn't compare to any other skies that they have fallen through. Never fear though, the giants have since left and the skies are now giant free - free to be enjoyed by the birds and beheld by all who desire. And everyone should desire to behold this amazing Preston Sky.<br>
                <br>
                Second, we must consider Preston's trees. Never before have such trees existed in all the earth. Preston's trees embody everything that a tree should be. They have trunks. They have branches. They have leaves. Roots, you ask? Why yes, they even have roots as well. Surely the perfection of these trees is becoming obvious to you now. The leaves are green, and the branches are brown. Some of the trees even grow fruit! The amazing qualities of the trees in Preston must not be overlooked.<br>
                <br>
                Third, but certainly not last, one must consider the residents of Preston themselves. Of course they contribute to the perfection of Preston. Without the residents, would Preston even exist? I think not! And the residents here do indeed, live in Preston. That cannot be argued. They both live, <em>and</em> reside here. Their talents to do both at the same time truly abound. If you think that I am exaggerating, you only need visit Preston and you will see houses. All sorts of houses, large and small, cute and even cuter, with these impressive residents actually living in these impressive houses. <br>
                <br>
                There is no denying it, Preston is simple perfect. No other opinion is valid, as there is simply no refuting the logic presented. Once you visit, you will see for yourself the perfection that is Preston Idaho.</p>
